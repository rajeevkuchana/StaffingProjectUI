        "shortFeedback": "I think you did a great job when you ran the all-hands meeting. It showed that you are capable of getting people to work together and communicate effectively. I admire your communication skills",
        "longFeedback": "In an organization with a strong and healthy feedback culture, people don't just give or receive feedback – they ask for it. That's why one way to diffuse tension around giving and receiving feedback is to ask for it more often. The more feedback is incorporated into your routine, the less stress builds up around feedback conversations. While we might be biased towards feedback at Culture Amp (one of our values is learning faster through feedback), we honestly believe that feedback is the best way for people to grow and develop. That's why we strongly recommend adopting upward feedback – giving feedback to your manager and others above you."
